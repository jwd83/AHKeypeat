# AHKeypeat

Collection of my autohotkey scripts I use to spam action buttons in MMOs.

Credit to [Kripparrian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcewYKebsx4) for
introducing me to this idea.

## multikey.ahk

While the following keys are being held down they will be alternatingly spammed
every 100ms along with modifiers shift, alt and control.

`1234567890-=`

# Deprecated

## The folowing scripts are deprecated in favor of multikey.ahk

### spam1.ahk

This will repeatedly spam keys 1 through 6 while they are being down every 100ms

### spam1s.ahk

In addition to what spam1.ahk does this will work for Shift + 1 through Shift +
6

### spam1sc.ahk

In addition to what spam1s.ahk does this will work for Control + 1 through
Control + 6
